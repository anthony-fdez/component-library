# Granite. A ReactJS component library

This library was a learning experience and I don't recommend you using it, use Mantine instead :)

Live Demo/Documentation: https://anthony-fdez.github.io/granite/

## Getting started

To install and get the project up and running you'll first need a React app

### Create ReactJS App

An easy and fast way to create a new React app is with Vite

Using JavaScript

```
npm create vite@latest my-react-app --template react
```

Using TypeScript

```
npm create vite@latest my-react-app --template react-ts
```

### Install Granite and peer dependencies

```
npm i @granite/core @emotion/react framer-motion
```
